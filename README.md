# Bill Manager V4
 Bill Manager V4 requires MySQL Server 8 and JDK 11. It uses Gradle 6.5 as the build tool,
although the Gradle wrapper can be used to build and run it instead (./gradlew run).
Use bills.sql to build the database.
 
This program is intended for use on Windows 10. I recommend using SQLBackupAndFTP to backup your 
database on Google Drive.

Please replace "password" with your own root password in Launcher.java. Also note
that run.bat must be modified if you intend to use it as a shortcut target.
