# Bill Manager V4
 Bill Manager V4 requires MySQL Server 8 and JDK 11. It uses Gradle 6.5 as the build tool,
although the Gradle wrapper can be used to build and run it instead (./gradlew run).

# Tips

* Use bills.sql to build the database.
* Replace "password" with your own root password in Launcher.java. This will be fixed later.
* Use run.bat as a shortcut target.
* This program is intended for use on Windows 10. 
* I recommend backing up your database using SQLBackupAndFTP.
